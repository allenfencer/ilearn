# iLearn

A new Flutter project created for Imagine Cup 2022.

An educational application designed and developed in flutter framework to help the students develop a skill for themselves and reach greater heights rather than just focusing on academics. The app was made with a very minimal interface making it easy for anyone to use.

# Features of the app
1.To help in consistent learning we would credit the users with learn Coins(LC), which they can use to redeem small gift vouchers or goodies through the app.

2.To ensure proper validation of the task, a validation section has been created to upload proof of work.

3.Additional activities within the app to earn more Learn Coins(LC).

4.Notifications to set a reminder, inorder to make sure that they do not forget to upload their daily task.
